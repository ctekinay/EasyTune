Best playlist manager money cannot buy

Have you ever been in a situation where you want to add multiple songs you have discovered but need to search and find all of them on Spotify one by one? 

Are you tired of how gruesome creating a Spotify Playlist of even 5-10 songs from different artists on Spotify because it requires you to find and add them to your playlist manually? Yikes!

Surely, there must be another way to add all the songs you love in one go! There is, right? No! 
Hmm... What if I say 'There is now and it works as effortlessly as one could imagine'?

It is called "EasyTune"! "How much?" you asked.!? Free... It's the best playlist manager money can't buy!

Enjoy your new playlists and share them with us!
